    <div class="header">
        This is <a href="https://vuejs.org/" class="link">Vue.js</a> based website made by a non web dev, hopefully good enough to display event-related info.

    <div class="header-title"> Scope </div>
    <div class="header">
        The goal of this project is to archive content related to japanese doujin events.<br>
        At least for now, the main focus is to find, archive and provide info on events where artists shared their music.<br>
        <br>
        This project DOES NOT SUPPORT PIRACY of content, but may host assets such as official images as it aims at providing an easy to access archive of publicly-available resources related to the events.

        <br>
        You may contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/kahpage/dea" class="link"> GitHub repository </a> (like raising an issue to ask for content, merge requests, ...).<br>
        You may also contact me <b>(kahpaibe)</b> on Discord. Please note that I may take a few days to answer by this mean.<br>

    <div class="header-title"> Licensing and stuff </div>
    <div class="header">
        While all code provided by me can be seen as open (MIT License), this website does share hosted content that may be copyrighted in some ways.<br>
        This is unavoidable by nature, but is why sourcing everything is important.
